# **Developer Guidelines**

<p><u>Last Updated - June 6th, 2025</u></p>

---

## **Introduction**

The ReX Engine Project relies on its developers and contributors to maintain a respectful, focused, and non-disruptive environment. This etiquette guide outlines expectations for behavior and collaboration to ensure a productive and inclusive development process.

Our shared goal is to build and improve the engine while fostering a space where all contributors feel valued, heard, and empowered to participate. If you ever feel that your ideas or proposals are being overlooked, it may be due to a misunderstanding or a misalignment with the guidelines described in this document. Clear communication and adherence to these expectations help ensure that everyone’s voice is fairly considered.


## **1. Be Respectful**

- Treat all contributors with kindness, patience, and professionalism.
- Avoid sarcasm, personal attacks, or inflammatory remarks —- especially during technical disagreements.
- Respect different skill levels, experiences, and backgrounds. Everyone is here to learn and contribute.
- Assume good intentions, and approach disagreements as opportunities to collaborate —- not compete.

??? danger "Examples of disrespectful behavior include"
    <div class="grid cards" markdown>

    - **Dismissing others’ ideas without discussion:** <hr/> *“You’re not listening—this just needs to be replaced.”*

    - **Speaking in a condescending or hostile tone:** <hr/> *“This is probably the dumbest thing I’ve heard.”*

    - **Overtalking or dominating discussions:** <hr/> Ignoring feedback, constantly steering conversation back to your own viewpoint, or not giving others a chance to speak.

    - **Mocking or belittling others’ efforts:** <hr/> Criticizing code, ideas, or questions in a way that discourages future contributions.

    - **Refusing to collaborate or compromise:** <hr/> Rejecting changes simply because they aren’t your own, or disregarding the community's or project leadership's consensus.

## 2. Communicate Clearly

- Use clear, concise language when writing comments, discord messages, commit messages, issues, or proposals.
- When making suggestions or raising concerns, explain your reasoning and provide helpful context.
- When proposing a solution or idea ensure you are following the suggestions in [Creating A Proposal](http://example.com)
- Ask questions when something isn’t clear—don’t assume everyone has the same understanding.
- Avoid passive-aggressive remarks or vague criticism. Be direct, but respectful.

        <div class="grid cards" markdown>

          - **Vague or unhelpful feedback:** <hr/> *“This is wrong.”* → Instead, explain *why* it’s wrong and how it could be improved.

          - **Unexplained decisions in pull requests:** <hr/> Making large changes without a description or justification makes it hard for others to understand the intent.

          - **Using overly technical jargon without explanation:** <hr/> This can alienate newer contributors. If you use advanced concepts, try to link documentation or explain briefly.

          - **Letting frustration show in comments:** <hr/> Venting in code reviews or issue threads creates a hostile environment.

    === ":fontawesome-solid-check:{.success} Tips for better communication"
        - Summarize problems and solutions clearly.
        - Use bullet points or code snippets where appropriate.
        - Assume others are reading without full context—provide it proactively.

## 3. Stay On Topic

- Keep conversations focused on the subject at hand, especially in pull requests, issues, and design discussions.
- Avoid derailing threads with unrelated ideas, personal side-conversations, or off-topic commentary.
- If a discussion naturally leads to a new subject, create a separate issue or thread to continue it.
- If discussing ideas in a general chat, it’s recommended to create a dedicated discussion thread for the topic.

### Why this matters:

- Staying on topic keeps discussions productive and easier to follow.
- It reduces noise and confusion, especially for new contributors trying to catch up.
- It helps maintain a clear project history and rationale for changes.

        - Introducing a new feature idea in the middle of a bug report discussion.
        - Debating unrelated architectural choices during a small bug fix PR.
        - Turning technical threads into personal chats or rants.
    === ":fontawesome-solid-check:{.success} Tips for staying on topic"
        - If you or another member realizes your comment is off-topic, acknowledge it and move it to the appropriate place.
        - Use threads or forum-style replies to isolate tangents if necessary.
        - Don’t be afraid to politely redirect the conversation if it’s drifting.

## 4. Use Proper Channels

- Use the appropriate platform for the type of communication:
    - **GitHub Issues** – for bug reports, feature proposals, and technical discussions that need tracking.
    - **Pull Requests** – for code contributions and change reviews.
    - **Discord Forums** – for longer-form design discussions and feedback on individual topics.
    - **Discord Chat** – for quick questions, casual conversation, and coordination.

- Avoid making important decisions in private messages or informal chats—use public channels so others can follow and participate.
- If a conversation in chat becomes in-depth or long-term, move it to a Discord forum post or another official discussion space.
- Keep general channels clear of deep technical debates—create threads to contain and organize complex discussions.

### Why this matters:

- Using the right channels ensures that information is visible, organized, and easy to reference later.
- It makes onboarding easier for new contributors trying to understand past decisions.
- It avoids losing important discussions in ephemeral chat history.

    === ":fontawesome-solid-xmark:{.danger} Poor channel usage"
        - Making a design decision in DMs and not documenting it publicly.
        - Posting lengthy PR feedback in Discord instead of in the pull request.
        - Starting a heated debate about a feature in a casual general chat channel.

    === ":fontawesome-solid-check:{.success} Best practices"
        - Default to transparency -- if it affects the project, make it public.
        - Link between chat and GitHub where necessary for continuity.
        - Use threads, tags, and titles to organize discussions clearly.
